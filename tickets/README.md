# NoteFlow — Build Tickets

Every requirement in the MVP spec is broken into a ticket. Tickets are grouped
into folders by area, numbered in the order they are normally built.

```
tickets/
├── 00-foundation/      project setup, tooling, app shell
├── 01-database/        Firebase, Firestore, collections, seed
├── 02-authentication/  "who are you?" — Auth.js, signup, login, logout, sessions
├── 03-authorization/   "what may you touch?" — ownership on every note operation
├── 04-notes/           create, read, update, delete
├── 05-search/          searching title and content
├── 06-pinning/         pin, unpin, pinned grouping
├── 07-ux-quality/      validation, empty/loading states, responsiveness, a11y
└── 08-deployment/      production config, Vercel, smoke tests, docs
```

## How to work a ticket

1. Read the ticket top to bottom before writing code, including its dependencies.
2. Branch as `<id>-<slug>`, e.g. `AUTH-003-registration-flow`.
3. Work the execution steps in order.
4. Tick every acceptance criterion yourself before opening the pull request.
5. Reference the id in the commit subject: `AUTH-003: add registration flow`.
